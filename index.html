            <h2>Background Information</h2>
          <p>Hotel and motel venues have become critical battlegrounds in the fight against human trafficking, particularly for sex trafficking. These locations are often exploited by traffickers due to their transient nature and accessibility. This project's purpose is to shed light on this pressing issue through data-driven visualizations, aiming to inform and inspire action within the hospitality industry, and use these visualizations and data analysis in order to help Mona fight against hotel negligence in respect to this problem by gathering datasets and articles. The project serves as an informative tool to highlight patterns and bring more attention to combating trafficking activities.</p>

            <h2>Major Project Goals</h2>
            <p>The main goal for the project of this semester is to create visualization that supports the idea that hotels and motels are often used as venues for sex trafficking. The visualizations are meant to be able to prove that hotels should establish regulations that train workers in detecting sex trafficking and forcing them to help. </p>

            <p>There is a lack of clear information and data on the use of hotels and venues, databases that have this information are not publicly available therefore, our goal has been divided into different tasks all with the hope to build up visualizations on these topics.
              <ul>

                <li>Create visualizations about the general topic of sex trafficking - COMPLETED </li>
                <li>Create our own database about sex trafficking with hotels as venues - IN PROGRESS</li>
                <li>Create visualizations regarding sex trafficking - IN PROGRESS</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
        </section>

         <section>
            <h2>Project Evolution</h2>
            <p>Over the semester, we searched for relevant information about child sex trafficking in hotels and made visualizations from the gathered data. Initially, we aimed to find data that are specifically about child sex trafficking in hotels, child sex trafficking, or hotel sex trafficking. Although we would find articles that include numbers, we had great difficulty tracking down the original source of the data, so after discussing with our client, we decided to shift our attention to making visualizations of the data we could find, even if they are not about the specific topics we are focusing on. Another problem we encountered was that some of the data are shown on pdfs, and copying and pasting out of them doesn't work, so we used AI to assist us transfer the pdf to usable data.</p>
            <p>Through our continuous communication with the client, we adapted our project to fitting the available resources that we were able to find. We also shifted away from gathering relevant articles because our client decided that as CSE students, our skills are more helpful to be applied in data visualization and technological side of the project. Throughout this project, keeping an open mind and adapting to new challenges enabled us to continue making progress and better serve the client's needs.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Our Struggle With Data</h2>
            <p>We started this project trying to find information regarding Human Trafficking with an emphasis on the use of hotels and motels as venues for sex trafficking. Because our main goal was to create visualization, the data we were looking for were databases containing keys and values that we could later modify to make different graphs that could hopefully help us identify trends. </p>
            <p>When we started the research, we found a lot of documents that mention the responsibilities of hotels in sex trafficking crimes however every time they used any statistics they would not say where that value was taken from or how it was calculated, it was impossible to find the underlying dataset. We looked through multiple articles - all of which made references to numbers that were simply not available to the general public, so we were forced to take a different approach to our project</p>
            <p>We decided we would use the data available by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, which only mentioned the general information about human trafficking and created impacting visualization on that information while two other team members continued the search for data. When trying to find information one person focused on making a collection of articles on sex trafficking cases and collecting the main data from each, while another team member focused on transforming already existing graphs into dictionaries or CSV with the help of AI that we could later use to create more visualizations.</p>
            <p>The lack of publicly available information was the biggest struggle we faced during our time working on the project, as it slowed us down significantly and prevented us from truly being able to complete our main goal. In the future, we would want to expand our graphs to have more motel/hotel-specific information, from data on how often hotel employees report a case to what hotel chains are the most used for these atrocious crimes. </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Next Steps</h2>
                <p>For the next steps of the project the idea is to continue collecting more information about the use of hotels/motels as venues for sex trafficking. We want to find information about the extent of the knowledge of workers when it comes to sex trafficking in hotels, common routes of sex trafficking and possible hotels as stops and common hotel chains used for this. </p>
                <p>Once we have gathered more information we will continue to use that data to create visualizations that support the claim.

            <h2>Team Reflection</h2>
            <h3>What Worked Well</h3>
            <p> Our communication worked very well. We had group messages that allowed us to quickly let others know what we have done, what needs to be done, what questions we had, and any reminders of deadlines. 
Additionally, we were really good at separating the task between the 4 of us allowing us to cover more ground. The way we divided the task 2 of us focused on furthering the research while 2 of us focused on creating the visualizations. 
            </p>
            
            <h3>Advice for Future Teams</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>This is a very sensitive topic to be researching on, and please take care of your health, both physically and mentally, as you take on this project. </li>
                <li>Keeping an open mindset throughout the project because it is greatly based on what data are found and what information are gathered.  </li>
                <li>Create a form of communication to keep every member up to date. </li>

            </ul>

            <h2>Resources for the Next Team</h2>
          <p>Initially the best way to get started with this project is to explore the information that has been gathered. Therefore you should take a look at every document but make emphasize on following documents: 
<ul>
            <li>In the Data Sources file look at all the cshti cvs these were the main databases used</li>
<li>In the Data Sources file read the document “A-Roadmap-for-Systems-and-Industries-to-Prevent-and-Disrupt-Human-Trafficking-Hotels-and-Motels”</li>
          </ul>
